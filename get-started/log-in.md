Once you’re an OpenLab member (see [Signing Up On The OpenLab]([url](https://openlab.citytech.cuny.edu/blog/help/signing-up-on-the-openlab))), you can log in two ways:

1. You can visit the OpenLab homepage and enter your username and password in the box on the left side, under **Log In**.  Once you do that, you’ll remain logged in wherever you go on the OpenLab.

This is also where you can recover your password if you’ve lost it. Simply click **Forgot Password?** beneath where you log in, and enter your username or City Tech email address on the next screen. Then log into your City Tech email and look for a message from the OpenLab.

2. You can also log in from any page or site on the OpenLab by clicking **Log In** at the top right corner of your screen.
